# Polygon Matic Community Faucet


```diff
- Website is down, VPS provider where backend was hosted for free is no longer prodiving us with the service
[update]
+ Website is back up!
! We had to change the domain name because the other one was provided by freedns.afraid.org and when migration to heroku for free hosting we had issues with SSL, and we couldn't use cloudflare "flexible" SSL since we had no control over the domain name.
